# MCServerLauncher

Allows for an easy way to create Vanilla and Spigot servers

Supports some arguments (use -help / -? to take a look)
Cool things:
When downloading a serer you can use "latest" to download the latest version of a server (release, not snapshot)


yeah, I really didn't plan this out much.
